# ATSmartHome
Using ArduiTouch hardware as a smart home control center. This is currently a work in progress, but uploaded files are always tested and should work.
The example ATSmartHome should not longer be used. There is a new example SmartHomeV2 for the ESP32 and SmartHomeV2_8266 for the ESP8266-E12

The SmartHome application is a smart home control center based on ArduiTouch(R) hardware. The communication between control center and remote devices uses WiFi and ESP-Now.
